# Introduction to a_game

A system for gamebuilding that holistically encompasses everything from the nitty-gritty of ECS and component
building, to providing a platform for storytelling, and networking: as demonstrated by a game we will build,
together.

#####Really, it's a pipedream.

This might be a clever pun*, but it's also a sad reality of interest-driven projects.

Right now, I'm the only person who's interested.   The Idea is to get a certain amount of the framework done
in order to facilitate greater interest.  This will probably look like a ECS with a good set of basic
components, as well as a general representation of a game experience.

A complete version of the entire system would facilitate networked multiplayer experience,
and actually be fun**.

 *More on this later.

#####A game can be more than the sum of its rules.
Storytelling is central to game creation,

Aside from the story, and the rules, a_game is a platform that exposes item creation
to player imagination -- by constraining certain paths, or increasing support for others ...
I can imagine a hackable roguelike where "magic" items are created by coding entities in an in-game terminal,
does this sound crazy to you?  like nethack meets telehack -- in an MMO-style setting.

Does that sound crazy?
[x]yes  [] no
