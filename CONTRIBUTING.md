# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Short checklist:

- Run `lein test` before filing a PR. Ensure all tests pass.
- Write small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes.
- Add tests for new behavior.

If you want to propose design changes (e.g., switching to nested atoms), open an issue first to discuss tradeoffs.
